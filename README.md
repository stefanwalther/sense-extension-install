## FAQ

**Question:** I am getting an error uploading the extension to Qlik Sense Server, what can I do?  
**Answer:**   
As you upload a .zip file to Qlik Sense Server I first recommend to unzip the file locally to have a look into the content of the .zip file:

- You should see a .qext file at the root of the .zip file's content

**Question:** Why can't I just download the GitHub project?  
**Answer:** I have structured all my extensions in the same way, so that you have a `./build` directory from where you can download multiple versions of an extension.
If you download the entire GitHub repository, it will contain most likely multiple .zip files containing a specific version of an extension.  
The solution is simple: Go to the `./build` directory and download the desired version, by default the go for the file %extension-name%_latest.zip
