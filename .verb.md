## FAQ

### I am getting error XYZ

First of all don't do download the entire GitHub repository, this is the most common mistake.

![](./docs/images/dont-github-download.png)

You are then downloading the entire GitHub repository, containing (potentially) multiple versions of an extensions.  
Importing the resulting .zip file will fail when importing in Qlik Sense.


### I am getting an error uploading the extension to Qlik Sense Server, what can I do?  

As you upload a .zip file to Qlik Sense Server I first recommend to unzip the file locally to have a look into the content of the .zip file:

- You should see a .qext file at the root of the .zip file's content

### Why can't I just download the GitHub project?  

I have structured all my extensions in the same way:

- There is a `./build` directory where you can download multiple versions of an extension.

If you download the entire GitHub repository, it will contain most likely multiple .zip files containing a specific version of an extension.  
The solution is simple: Go to the `./build` directory and download the desired version, by default the go for the file %extension-name%_latest.zip
